		/*
		 * alright new plan for moves
		 * store literally every move (including pokepowers) into movelist
		 * shuffle movelist
		 * sort movelist to have all pokepowers at the end NOTE loop through movelist backwards
		 * create a list of all pokemon indices
		 * shuffle this list
		 * 
		 *	loop through all pokemon indices
		 *	walk through MoveList until we find one that comes from the same stage as the current pokemon (if necessary)
		 *	add current move to pokemon, remove from movelist
		 * 	if the current move is a pokepower, walk through moveList until a new move that works on the current pokemon (and is not a pokepower) shows up 
		 * 	attach the new move to the current pokemon and remove it from the movelist
		 * 	if we had to deal with a pokepower, remove the current pokemon's index from the list as it now has 2 moves
		 * 	continue until we hit the end of the list of pokemon
		 * 
		 * 	loop through the remaining pokemon
		 * 	walk through MoveList until we find one that comes from the same stage as the current pokemon (if necessary) OR we reach the end of movelist
		 * 	if we found a move, add it to the current pokemon, remove both from their respective lists (technically the pokemon doesn't have to be removed)
		 * 	if we did not find a move, skip this pokemon and move on to the next pokemon
		 * 	continue until we run out of moves (which will occur before the end of the pokemon list every single time, i believe, as no stage has every pokemon with 2 moves)
